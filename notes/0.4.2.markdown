* Added `makeBeanAttribute()` methods, which automatically map Scala objects
  to Java Beans for use with StringTemplate. Addresses Scalasti [Issue #1][].
* Moved `isOfType` method to the [ClassUtil][] library.
* Updated to released 1.2 version of [ScalaTest][] and updated the dependency
  to be a test, rather than runtime, one.
* Moved unit testers into package-specific subdirectories.
