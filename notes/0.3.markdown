* Added support for [automatic aggregate creation][], via the new
  `StringTemplate.setAggregate()` methods.
* Changed `StringTemplate` interface to support `Any`, not just `AnyRef`
  attribute values.
* Various `set` methods in `StringTemplate` now return the template.
* Updated to version 0.7 of [Grizzled Scala][].
* Now compiles with Scala 2.8.0.RC3, as well as RC2. Dropped support for RC1.
