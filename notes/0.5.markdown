* Added `makeBeanAttribute()` methods, which automatically map Scala objects
  to Java Beans for use with StringTemplate. Addresses Scalasti [Issue #1][].
* Moved `isOfType` method to the [ClassUtil][] library.
* Updated to released 1.2 version of [ScalaTest][] and updated the dependency
  to be a test, rather than runtime, one.
* Moved unit testers into package-specific subdirectories.
* Now published to the [Scala Tools Maven repository][], which [SBT][]
  includes by default. Thus, if you're using SBT, it's longer necessary to
  specify a custom repository to find this artifact.
